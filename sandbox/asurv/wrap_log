* Collected KM estimator subroutines
* Eliminate printing statements
* Eliminate "J" parameter selector/slot; Python will pass only the
  variable of interest.  This requires changing several dimension
  statements and removing parameters.
* Eliminate IBIN param; dim for all binning params is the # of bins.
* Add SMEAN, ERROR params (just printed in original)
* SUMRY has a dimension inconsistency with its calls for the
  U() param.  Made S and U both of dim(IU) --- the Python
  wrapper should ensure this.  Renamed QUART.
* Separate out KMDIF
